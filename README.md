# Sonic-1-AS-Disassembly
This is an updated AS disassembly, which was built off the older one. This is made to make hacking/editing easier. For those who hate AS, too bad! Anyway, here's the features:
1. Some better labels from the Sonic 2 Github disassembly
2. Some macros have been added to make editing easier
3. Variables are now labeled, this makes RAM shifting easier
4. Unneeded ASM files have been moved to s1.asm
